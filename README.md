# Next 14 App Router example for creating a wallet session.

This is an example specifically for the Lukso eco system but could easily be tweaked to work on other chains. All this examples does is provide a front end wallet connection and prompts a `siwe` message for the user to sign, then sends that information to the backend to be verified and added to the session.
